# PIC-SURE_API BioData Catalyst examples
This folder contains various PICSURE API use-cases and illustration examples using BioData Catalyst studies. PIC-SURE API is available in two languages --R and python. PIC-SURE API requires R 3.5 or later, or python 3.6 or later.

# Repo organization

Several Jupyter/RMarkdown notebooks examples are available for both R and python in the respective subfolders:
  - get_your_token.ipynb: **Start from here if you're using the PIC-SURE API for the first time**. This notebook explain how to get a user specific security token, mandatory to be able to run the other notebooks.
  - PICSURE-API_101.ipynb: An illustration of the main functionalities of the PIC-SURE API. It describes in more details the different functionalities of the API
  - PheWAS.ipynb: A straightforward PIC-SURE API use-case, using a PheWAS analysis as an illustration example.
  - HarmonizedVariables_analysis.ipynb: An example of how to access and work with the "harmonized variables" across the TOPMed studies.
